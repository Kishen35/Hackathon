## Inspiration
Due to the covid 19 pandemic, local grocers have lost their livelihood. People have lesser options to choose from, thus relying only on supermarkets for daily provisions. This eliminated the ability for people to be able to bargain for the price. As such, the team decided to come up with a platform to connect small businesses who are unable to transition to the online market during the pandemic era.

## What's next for Untitled
Mainly grow the user base first (similar to Snapchat)
Planning to add the advertisement option for businesses that want to be featured on the front-page
