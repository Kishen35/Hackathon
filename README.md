## Problem Statement
Since the pandemic, Malaysia imposed several lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19. This had a significant impact on the residents socially and economically. How can we help our country to recover socially and economically, while following through with the National Recovery Plan (NRP)?. 

## Inspiration
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many small businesses such as small shop owners and market merchants have lost their main income stream due to tight SOPs and regulations that forbid them from doing their business physically.

However, they are unable to transition themselves onto the online market and are cannot keep up with the online trend due to the lack of familiarity with modern technology.

The livelihood of local grocers is also affected as they are forced to buy from supermarkets and grocery giants.

## Our Solution
MarketConnect is a social platform to connect small businesses who are unable to transition to the online market during the pandemic era with potential customers nearby.

-   Allows merchants to easily and seamlessly transition partially towards the online market
-  Provides more transparency during the trading of goods
-   Incurs zero commission fee towards the merchants who are already struggling financially
-   Aims to be a localised market distribution in which customers trade with nearby merchants for ease of accesss

## Monetization
Since no commission fee is incurred, this solution relies on advertising for long term sustainability. In app messaging and payment systems can also be integrated alongside custom delivery options to allow for a more seamless trading experience between merchants and customers.
